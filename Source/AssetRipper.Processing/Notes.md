# Visual Effects

`VisualEffectAsset`s are not fully recoverable. The `VisualEffectAsset` itself is recoverable, but that is not very useful because its original structure is lost. Normal `vfx` files are structured like this:

* `MonoBehaviour` uv info - the `MonoBehaviour` that specifies various properties like the UI bounds.
  * It is referenced from the graph.
* `MonoBehaviour` graph - the graph of nodes that make up the visual effect.
  * It is referenced from the resource.
* `VisualEffectResource` - the asset that contains the name and render settings.
  * It has a "random" fileID. In the single example I've seen, it was `8926484042661614527`.

There is no `VisualEffectAsset` encoded because it is silently generated by the `VisualEffectImporter`. In the single example I've seen, its fileID was `8926484042661614526`, 1 less than the `VisualEffectResource`.

All the MonoBehaviours have a standard fileID, ie 114 followed by 15 random digits.

Without the `VisualEffectResource`, errors are thrown when adding a visual effect to a scene.
